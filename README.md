In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Starts the project so you can view the front-end

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Local server (enter local server directory)

Because I don't want a whole backend for just one file, and I cannot post and edit with fetch from my json file, I've installed json-server
which will serve as our own local REST API<br>
To start the server, I have defined the script inside the folder. To start it:<br>
open dir:"my-server" in terminal and run

### `npm install`

### `npm run json:server

### `npm run deploy

for deployment with ftp-deploy
